Currently have selected questions around reported perceptions of loneliness and number of friends as features in our model to determine if these factors can predict the risk of cyberbullying, verbal bullying, and physical bullying. This is due to research on bullying that has found social isolation to be a significant factor that causes students to be bullied at school.
